Here's some more about my journey: I attended the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu) where I completed my [Bachelor of Science](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mse025gT3OAlMV8zpEeCbyz28JgD_RhL/view?usp=sharing) _cum laude_ in Game Design and Development.

Today, I'm currently working as the game designer for several minigames in the [Rowdy Rascals](https://twitter.com/Rowdy_Rascals) indie game project, where I'm responsible for developing game mechanics and building those mechanics into captivating levels.

I was also awarded Best Narrative and 1st Place in the [Find The Kind Game Jam](https://ithrivegames.org/priceless/) by the iThrive Game Foundation.

Here is a list of the technologies that I most commonly work with!
