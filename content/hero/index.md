I'm a dedicated game developer based in New York with a goal-driven creative mindset along with a passion for learning and innovating.

Currently working as a Game Dev with [Rowdy Rascals](https://twitter.com/Rowdy_Rascals) and as a Freelance Graphic Designer with [Family & Children's Aid](https://www.fcaweb.org/) non-profit.

In my free time, I create multimedia art projects which you can check out on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/raedreaming/) and spend time in the great outdoors- hiking, biking, or roller-skating!
